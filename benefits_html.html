    <h2 class="parallax">ECOLOGICAL BENEFITS</h2>
    <p class="parallax_description"> Prairies are one of the most unique ecotypes in the world, and as a result, provide a series of unique ecological benefits.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="about" id="about">
    <h2 class="hidden">About</h2>
    <p class="text_column">Across the US, especially in the Midwest, there is a soil crisis looming. Loss of surface soil and overall soil fertility due to intensive agriculture practices have put the future of Americaâ€™s breadbasket at stake. One natural solution to mitigating the loss of topsoil and soil fertility would be to restore prairie areas to these depleted fields. &nbsp;When compared to agricultural fields, restored prairies had significantly healthier soils. Soil moisture, organic matter, total carbon, nitrogen and sulfur content, and water holding capacity were all found in much higher levels in restored areas compared to agricultural fields </p>
    <p class="text_column"> Before Europeans arrived in North America, prairie soils were deep and rich, often storing as much carbon below ground as a hardwood forest would above ground. Original remnant prairie wetlands are most beneficial, followed by previously restored areas. Recently restored land provides the least benefits when it comes to greenhouse gas absorption. While maintaining original habitats offer the most carbon sequestration and methane capture, this option is often no longer available. The next best option is to restore a degraded prairie or create one, and the benefits will accumulate over time </p>
    <p class="text_column">Planting prairie also brings a host of other of ecological benefits. Species richness of insects, particularly pollinators, greatly increase in the presence of a prairie. Native bird richness and abundance of native, threatened species are also found in higher numbers. Water runoff is greatly reduced and soil retention increases astronomically. In addition, phosphorus remained in the soil more successfully. In terms of water, prairies can act as a reservoir, especially in times of flooding. They also help to recharge groundwater reserves and store excess nutrients. </p>

    <h2 class="parallax">ECONOMIC BENEFITS</h2>
    <p class="parallax_description">Prairies are not only ecologically beneficial, but economically as well. Ecological restoration and economic benefits are often seen as mutually exclusive, but when in reality, they go hand in hand.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="about" id="about">
    <h2 class="hidden">About</h2>
    <p class="text_column">In real estate, the most import rule is location, location, location. Although numbers range heavily, adjoining and frontal locations of property near natural or restored areas tend to be worth 20% more than sites not close to natural areas. In some cases, property values may be increased up to 35%. With this increase in property values, property taxes tend to increase as well, offsetting any tax revenue difference between developing an area for businesses &nbsp;or &nbsp;conservation.</p>
    <p class="text_column">In addition, restoring a natural area is not the end of its economic life cycle. After being restored, an average natural ecosystem can expect to keep around 75% of its initial value after 20 years, a rate better than most businesses . In a cost-benefit analysis of restoration efforts on all types of biomes, grasslands topped the list with average cost benefit ratios of 35:1, and like the rest of the biomes surveyed, with maintenance costs roughly at 10% or below. In other studies,&nbsp;grasslands again proved to be the most cost-effective ecosystem to restore, ranging from a worst case +34% to a best case +58%.</p>
    <p class="text_column">In a study by the U.S. Geological Survey, researchers found that after adding up job-years, labor income, and economic output, a restored prairie added $1.8 million in value per $1 million invested. In addition, the total economic impact came out to be $3.4 million added per $1 million invested. The onset of prairie grasses creates a habitat for pollinators like monarch butterflies, providing valuable ecosystem services to local farms and fields. In addition, prairie grass is prime grazing feed for cattle, controlling weeds in the process, keeping feed and other livestock costs down. </p>

    <h2 class="parallax">SOCIAL BENEFITS</h2>
    <p class="parallax_description">The social benefits that come from Prairies can be wide ranging, allowing provide people with the opportunity to follow outdoor passions like bird watching , hunting, and cross-country skiiing.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="about" id="about">
    <h2 class="hidden">About</h2>
    <p class="text_column">What are not often discussed are the significant benefits to the social aspects of prairie restoration. Understanding how people perceive the beauty of ecologically restored landscapes influences how much support will be received for these projects. As humans, the aesthetic pleasure derived from landscape experience is a reflection of evolution and contemporary environmental behavior, including prairie restoration. </p>
    <p class="text_column">Restoration of prairies is also beneficial to human health. Utilizing wild and restored areas can help with mental health of older adults. It is widely known that physical activity improves health outcomes for older adults. In fact, elderly people who spend more time outdoors are significantly less likely to suffer from depression. Bird watching and other wildlife observation activities are noted as well established ways to interest local residents in utilizing ecologically restored areas. </p>
    <p class="text_column">Priaire restoration has lead to many opportunities for recreation. These recreational activities include but are nort limited to: hunting, bird watching, cross country skiing, and other activities that can be in enjoyed in all four seasons. Many of these opportunities allow people to create their own social circles by forming programs like the Prairie Enthusiasts. This also provides opportunities for communities to come together and make connections over a love of nature.</p>
