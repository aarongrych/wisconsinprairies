    <h2 class="hidden">About</h2>
    <p class="text_column"> <b>At one point, prairies littered the landscape of the Upper Midwest from Texas to North Dakota </b>. Nowadays, less than 1% of all original prairie landscapes hav been lost to the ages. Often converted into farmland due to their rich soils, prairies were highly coveted lands for pioneers and homesteaders.  </p>
    <p class="text_column"> <b>Prairies are a landscape unique to the central United States, found no other place on earth </b>. Because of this isolation, the specifics of this incredible ecotype often go unknown. There are three main types of prairie: Dry, Mesic, and Wet. Dry prairies are have little water and are often situated on limestone or sand bases. Mesic Prairies have some water, good drainage and generally are made up of either sandy loam soil, or deep silt. Wet prairies have poor drainage and deep clay loam or peat soil. </p>
    <p class="text_column"> <strong> Prairies are classified as a part of the temperate grasslands, savannahs, and shrublands biome </strong>. They are made up of sedges, grasses, and flowering plants called forbs. On prairies, you can often find common plants such as silpiums, black eyed susans, coneflowers, and rare plants like the eastern prairie white fringed orchid. For animal life, Bobolinks, Dickcissels and Henslow's sparrow as well as Prairie Chickens can be spotted. </p>

      <img src="140731145937_1_540x360.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="200" class="cards"/>
      <p>Prairies are one of the most unique ecotypes on earth. They often contain flowers, grasses, and soils that are not found anywhere else. In addition, prairies are the only ecotype that requires frequent manual burning in order to maintain the correct composition of plants and soil nutrients. This constant recycling of carbon creates an extremely fertile soil, highly coveted by farmers and settlers alike. </p>
